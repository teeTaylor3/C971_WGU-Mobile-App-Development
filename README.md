Mobile Application Development

As a competent mobile application developer, your understanding of mobile application structure and design will help you to develop applications to meet customer requirements.

For this task, you will develop a multiple-screen mobile application for WGU students to track their academic terms, courses associated with each term, and assessments associated with each course. The application will allow students to enter, edit, and delete term, course, and assessment data. It should provide summary and detailed views of courses for each term, provide notifications for upcoming performance and objective assessments, and notify students of deadlines and tracking milestones even after the application is closed. You will create a wireframe as a visual guide, representing the skeletal framework of the application. Your application will use an SQLite database.

This task will allow you to demonstrate your ability to apply the skills learned in the course and help you to apply these skills in a familiar, real-world scenario.
